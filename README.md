## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It helps in understanding the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that perform EDA on a selected commodity data set.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chahanjanhae/EDA-Analaysis-Using-Python-on-Commoditiy-Data-Set.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd EDA-Analaysis-Using-Python-on-Commoditiy-Data-Set
```

You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Chahanjanhae/EDA-Analaysis-Using-Python-on-Commoditiy-Data-Set/releases). Please download the necessary files and execute them as instructed in the documentation.

## Usage

To run the analysis, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, you can open the Jupyter notebook and start exploring the data. Run the cells sequentially to see the outputs.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis comes from various reputable sources. Here are some common sources for commodity data:

- U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
- World Bank
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Commodity exchanges (e.g., Chicago Mercantile Exchange)

Make sure to check the original sources for more detailed information and updates.

## Analysis Techniques

This project employs various EDA techniques, including:

- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Time series analysis
- Outlier detection

These techniques help in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a key role in EDA. The repository includes several types of plots, such as:

- Histograms
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Line charts

These visualizations provide insights into the data and help in communicating findings effectively.
